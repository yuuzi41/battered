# battered

a WSGI middleware for lazy people who can't be bothered to build OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone).

It works like a kind of TempAuth, but it also provides an API that is subset of OpenStack Identity API V2.
This supports Authentication only.

## how to use
use this as middleware in proxy pipeline.

TODO: write this section more.

## TODO:
* use config (at this time, we have to set auth info in code.)
